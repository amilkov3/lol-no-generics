# Cabal and Stack: The Mish Mash that is the current state of Haskell build tools

Actually I suppose that title is misleading. I haven't waded through cabal that much. Mostly because I haven't found a need to. Once I wrapped my head around stack enough (an ongoing process), I never had the need to fiddle with cabal. However, with regard to creating new projects, you'll find that as of now, stack and cabal are inextricably intertwined.
